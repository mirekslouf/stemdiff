stemdiff.dbase
--------------
Functions to calculate, save and re-read the database of 4D-STEM datafiles.

* The database is saved as a pandas.DataFrame object,
  which contains the following data for each datafile:
  filename, XY-center coordinates, MaximumIntensity, NoOfPeaks, ShannonEntropy.
* The database enables fast filtering of datafiles
  and fast access to datafile features,
  which do not have to be re-calculated repeatedly.

    Parameters
    ----------
