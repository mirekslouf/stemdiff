STEMDIFF package
----------------
Conversion of a 4D-STEM dataset to a 2D-powder diffration pattern.

* Input = 4D-STEM dataset = 2D-array of 2D-NBD patterns.
    - 2D-array = usually one (or more) two-dimensional scanning array(s).
    - 2D-NBD = monocrystalline-like nanobeam diffraction pattern.
* Output = 2D-powder diffraction pattern
    - The final 2D-diffractogram is a specific summation of 2D-NBD patterns.
    - In other words, a 4D-STEM dataset is reduced to a 2D-diffraction pattern.
    - The whole method (and final pattern) is called 4D-STEM/PNBD (powder NBD).
    
STEMDIFF modules:
    
* stemdiff.dbase = calculate database of 4D-stem datafiles 
* stemdiff.detectors = objects describing detectors and format of the datafiles
* stemdiff.gvars = objects describing *source data* and *diffraction images*
* stemdiff.io = input/output for datafiles and corresponding arrays + images
* stemdiff.sum = summation of datafiles (standard, serial processing)
* stemdiff.summ = summation of datafiles (parallel, multicore processing)

STEMDIFF auxiliary package IDIFF and its modules:

* IDIFF contains functions for the improvement of diffraction patterns
* IDIFF is imported below so that it could be used as: sd.idiff.some_module
* IDIFF modules are:
    - idiff.bcorr = background correction/subtraction
    - idiff.deconv = advanced deconvolution methods
    - idiff.ncore = noise correction/reduction
    - idiff.psf = estimate of PSF function
